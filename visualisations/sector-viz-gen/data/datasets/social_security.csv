Thus, there is no allocation for RSSY in the 2016-17 (BE) and 2017-18 (BE). National Health Protection Scheme, with similar mandate, was announced in 2016-17. However in Union Budget, 2018-19, RSBY has been reintroduced into the Health and Family Welfare Department. Hence, over the years, the allocations for health protection for unorganised workers have been recorded under different scheme names."
